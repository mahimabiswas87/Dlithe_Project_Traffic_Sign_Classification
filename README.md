Traffic Signs Recognition
Traffic signs can be analysed using forward-facing cameras in many modern cars, vehicles and trucks. One of the basic use cases of a traffic-sign recognition system is for speed limits. Modern traffic-sign recognition systems are being developed using convolutional neural networks, mainly driven by the requirements of autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. In these scenarios, the detection system needs to identify a variety of traffic signs and not just speed limits. A convolutional neural network can be trained to take in these predefined traffic signs and 'learn' using Deep Learning techniques.
The German Traffic signs recognition benchmark dataset (GTSRB) is used to build a Data Science Project on Traffic Signs Recognition using CNN in Python language.
